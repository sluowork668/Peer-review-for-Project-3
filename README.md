## Project Objective
**Description:**
I found my favorite game book (Math Games with Bad Drawings) at [MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu) in Kendall Square. This book introduces 75 math-based puzzle games that are intended to be played with pencil, paper, and dice. Our favorite is “SIM” which is a Ramsey theory (basically a mix of economics and probability theory named after Frank Ramsey) game where two players attempt play a multi-color connect-the-dots on the same hexagon shape while trying to force their opponent to make a triangle shape while defensively avoiding that outcome for themself.

**User Stories/Personas:**
Addy: As a user, I want a quick and addictive game to play while commuting without the mess of dice and paper colored pencils. I want to be able to play with a bot and have unlimited time between turns.
Bijesh and Cassandra: As a user, I want to play a game with a non-local friend without needing to download a whole video game and want to keep track of game count and scores over time. I want a 30 second time limit between turns.
Danielle: As a user, I want to learn game theory / math concepts by actively applying those concepts in a way that reading a textbook would not.

## Instructions to Build / Run

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- A [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) account and connection string

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Math-Chaos.git
cd Math-Chaos
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file inside the `backend/` folder:
```bash
nano backend/.env
```
Add the following:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/mathchaos
PORT=5001
```
> Reminder: Never commit your `.env` file. Make sure it's listed in `.gitignore`.

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install packages for both the backend and frontend:
```bash
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
```

### 4. Run the App
You'll need **two terminal tabs** running simultaneously.

**Terminal 1 — Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 — Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 5. Open in Browser
Once both servers are running, visit:
```
http://localhost:5173
```

## Tech Stack
**Frontend**
React (via Vite)

**Backend:**
Node.js + Express
WebSockets (ws library)

**Datebase:**
MongoDB (hosted on MongoDB Atlas)
